# Overview
This repository contains my Cybersecurity Incident Handling Journal.  
It documents simulated and real-world cybersecurity incidents, structured according to professional frameworks such as **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** and **NIST Incident Response Lifecycle**.




## Incident summaries


#### 01-Ransomware attack.
Date: July 21,2025<br>
Category: Malware<br>
Reference Framework: NIST Incidence Response Lifecycle<br>
Description: Unethical hackers were able to access the companyâ€™s systems through a phishing attack. They deployed ransomware, encrypting the company files and then leaving a note for ransom so that a decryption key would be provided to decrypt the data.



#### 02-Phishing attack.
Date: July 23, 2025<br>
Category: Social Engineering<br>
Reference Framework: NIST Incidence Response Lifecycle<br>
Descripton: An employee received an email with an attachment. He clicked on the attachment and a malicious file was downloaded on his computer, accessing his system and stealing company's sensitive info.



#### 03-Web Application attack.
Date: July 26,2025<br>
Category: Broken Access Control<br>
Framework Reference: NIST Incident Response Lifecycle<br>
Description: The company had a vulnerability in it's e-commerce web application. The vulnerability allowed the attacker to perform a forced browsing attack and access customer transaction data by modifying the order number included in the URL string of a purchase confirmation page. The attacker got access to customer data, which he then collected and exfiltrated, further the attacker left a note demanding payment as ransom for not releasing the data on public forums.



#### 04-Capturing my first packet.
Date: July 27,2025<br>
Description:  I used tcpdump to capture and analyze network traffic. Tcpdump is a network protocol analyzer that's accessed using the command-line interface.



#### 05-Analyzing a packet capture file.
Date: July 27,2025<br>
Description: I used wireshark to analyze a packet capture file. Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer having a graphical user interface



#### 06-Investigating a suspicious file hash.
Date: July 30,2025<br>
Description: An employee was able to download and execute a malicious file attachment via e-mail. The file attachment had a SHA-256 file hash of 54e6ea47eb04634d3e87fd7787e2136ccfbcc80ade34f246a12cf93bab527f6b, so I used virustotal to analyze the file hash, which was reported as malicious.
